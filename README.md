## 🚀 About MongoDB
MongoDB is a **NoSQL (Not Only SQL)** Database Management System used to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

Unlike traditional relational databases:
- It does **not** store data in rows and columns.
- It stores data in **documents** (JSON-like format).
- It is highly scalable and flexible.
